Around a month passed. Days in Hell felt surprisingly similar to days on Earth.
Trisetar and I spent the time sitting down and researching the button. After figuring out that there was nothing left on the button itself, we began to research cross-dimensional communication.
However, there was one key difference.
We did it together.

We sat next to each other at the table, a stack of books next to us.
While I struggled reading the complicated mumbo jumbo, Trisetar was reading through them at a blazing fast race.
@sfx thud
Suddenly, I heard a loud thud.
F.f>shock,sfx>flinch: H-huh?
Trisetars face was flat on the desk.
F.f>sad,sfx>sweat: Uh...
I lightly tapped his shoulder, but no response. Gosh, those diamond things on his arms were sharp.
@spawn ShakeCharacter params:F
Carefully, I tried to avoid his horns and touched his hair. Not in like, a creepy way or anything. I was just curious how it felt. It was surprisingly soft.
T.f>anger,sfx>anger: What do you think you're doing?
I froze up.
F.f>shock: N-Nothing?
Trisetar raised his head from the desk and rubbed his eyes, then yawned.
T.anger: That did not seem like 'nothing.'
F.sad: I-I was just surprised by how soft your hair is.
T.f>sad,sfx>blush: I-Is that so?
Trisetar reached for his head, touching the same place I did. Then, he reached up to my hair and touched it.
@char T pos:65
I flushed.
@char T pos:75 wait:false
T.neutral: It does not feel different to me.
F.f>shock,sfx>blush: O-Oh.
I scrambled for a subject change.
F.neutral: So uh, you get sleepy too?
T.f>anger,sfx-: Of course. Sleep is necessary for any mortal vessel.
@camera offset:-3,1 zoom:.5
F.f>shock,sfx-: I thought you're not mortal!
@camera offset:0 zoom:0
T.neutral: I may not be mortal, but this vessel is. Demonic identity lies in the soul, not the body.
F.sad: Huh. Interesting. So you die too?
T.anger: Yes, but the soul is carried over to a new body.
F.shock: Wow... I would've never imagined.
Suddenly, my mind was turning with questions about the technicalities of being a demon. As if he could read my mind, Trisetar raised his hand.
@spawn ShakeCharacter params:T,2,,,,,true,false
T.neutral: No more questions.
F.sad: How did you know?
T.anger: I just had to take one look at your face.
@char F.blush
@spawn ShakeCharacter params:F,2,,,,,true,false
I shyly scratched the back of my neck. I didn't realize I was that easy to read.
Then Trisetar leaned back into my chest.
@char T pos:60
F.f>shock: H-Huh?
T.f>anger,sfx>blush: Quiet.
My head rested snugly in between those two terrifyingly sharp horns.
F.blush: What are youâ€”
T.sad: I said 'Quiet,' do you not understand that much?
@spawn ShakeCharacter params:F
F.neutral: I-It's just...
I felt myself heat up.
T.anger: I am drained. Let me rest.
Tentatively, I wrapped my arms around Trisetar's chest. When he pressed himself closer, A strange feeling bubbled up my chest.
I wanted...

@choice "To stay like this forever." goto:.forever

# forever
@set hell=hell+1
@camera offset:-4,2 zoom:.7 wait:true
I liked this.
I liked the comfortable silence between us.
@char F.f>happy,sfx>blush
I enjoyed looking at Trisetar's reactions to things, and how he taught me new things everyday.
I wanted to stay like this forever.
F.anger: (Snap out of it, Felix...)
This was only temporary, I needed to remind myself.
But a small voice in my head whispered... did it need to be?
@goto .continue

# home
@set home=home+1
@camera offset:-4,2 zoom:.7 wait:true
Trisetar was really interesting. Despite being a demon, he was surprisingly sheltered.
Even though the demon world was a lot of fun, I felt he wasn't exactly in his element.
@char F.f>happy,sfx>blush
He wanted to go back home, but not alone.
F.anger: (No... don't think about that...)
His tiny apartment wasn't nearly the size of Trisetar's mansion, but it was still his home.
No, that wasn't part of the plan.
But a small voice in my head whispered... maybe it could be.
@goto .continue

# continue
@char F.default
I almost shook my head, before realizing I physically couldn't.
As Trisetar's chest rose and fell in even breaths, I thought to myself...
F.f>sad,sfx>sweat: (What's going to happen to me...?)
